## Welcome to Public Sans!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), our [LICENSE](https://github.com/uswds/public-sans/blob/master/LICENSE.md), and our [README](https://github.com/uswds/public-sans/blob/master/README.md).
